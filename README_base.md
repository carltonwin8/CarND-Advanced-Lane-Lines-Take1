# Advanced Lane Finding Project

The pre-fork README can be found [here](README_ori.md).
This README contains my notes for the project.
The IPython notebooks can be found [here as ipynb](advancedLaneFinding.ipynb) and
[here as html](http://carltonwin8.github.io/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines).

The steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

## Camera Calibration

I start by preparing "object points", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of
the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed
on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each
calibration image. Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and
`objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect
all chessboard corners in a test image. `imgpoints` will be appended with the
(x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each
successful chessboard detection.
The code for these operation is in the
[Find Chessboard Corners On A Number Of Calibration Images](http://carltonwin8.github.io/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines#chessboard)
cell.

I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera
calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()`
function.
The code for these operation is in the
[Calibarte Camera](http://carltonwin8.github.io/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines#calibrate)
cell.

I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the
`cv2.undistort()` function and obtained these result:
The code for these operation is in the
[Test Camera Calibration With Images](http://carltonwin8.github.io/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines#testCalibration)
cell.
The following images shows the test results.

| Original Image | Undistorted Image | Original Image | Undistorted Image
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| ![](camera_cal/calibration1.jpg) | ![](output_images/calibration1.jpg) | ![](test_images/straight_lines1.jpg) | ![](output_images/straight_lines1.jpg) |

## Edge Detect

I used the sobel X gradient thresholds _anded_ with the HLS color space S
channel threshold to generate a binary image.
The code for these operation is in the
[Threshold binary image creating via color transform and gradient](http://carltonwin8.github.io/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines#thresholds)
cell.
The following images shows the results from this step.

| sobel x | hls s | x s AND color | x s AND

## Perspective Transform

The code for this operation is in the
[Perspective Transform](http://carltonwin8.github.io/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines#perspectiveTransform)
cell.
The `cv2.getPerspectiveTransform()` function creates a transform from the
source (`src`) and destination (`dst`) points noted below.

```python
src = np.float32(
    [[(img_size[0] / 2) - 55, img_size[1] / 2 + 100],
    [((img_size[0] / 6) - 10), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 5 / 6) + 60, img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] / 2 + 55), img_size[1] / 2 + 100]])
dst = np.float32(
    [[(img_size[0] / 4), 0],
    [(img_size[0] / 4), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), 0]])

```
This resulted in the following source and destination points:

| Source        | Destination   |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| 585, 460      | 320, 0        |
| 203, 720      | 320, 720      |
| 1127, 720     | 960, 720      |
| 695, 460      | 960, 0        |

The transform was tested on the images noted below to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.

####4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?

Then I did some other stuff and fit my lane lines with a 2nd order polynomial kinda like this:

![alt text][image5]

####5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

I did this in lines # through # in my code in `my_other_file.py`

####6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.

I implemented this step in lines # through # in my code in `yet_another_file.py` in the function `map_lane()`.  Here is an example of my result on a test image:

###Pipeline (video)

####1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video.mp4)

---

###Discussion

####1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked
and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were
going to pursue this project further.  

## TODO

  - see if i can get the overlay the `src` and `dst` points on the transformed
    and non-transformed images.
